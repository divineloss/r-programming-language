# R Syntax

### Basics

The R language is a programming language used for conducting statistics and other specialized data analyses. It uses operators and conditional statements. Similar to languages like Python, it uses a print statement to bring the results of code to the screen. 

It works with the following data types:

| Type | Description |
| - | - |
| Numeric | Any number iwth ot without a decimal point |
| Character | Any grouping of characters on your keyboard or text. Most strings are surrounded by single quotes or double quotes, although single is preferred. AKA "string" |
| Logical | Either TRUE or FALSE. Similar to booleans. |
| Vectors | A list of related data that is all the same. |
| NA | Represents the absence of a value. There can be a numeric NA, a character NA and a logical NA. |

Variables - Allows R to store inforamtion and associate it with a name. Uses the operator <- to assign variables. An equal sign CAN be used but the <- operator is preferred. 

Vectors - Similar to an array in Python, these are lists that contain items of the same data type. Note that unlike python, elements are counted starting at position one, not zero.
